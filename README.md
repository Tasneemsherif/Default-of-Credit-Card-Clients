# Default-of-Credit-Card-Clients
Default of Credit Card Clients machine learning project
# Credit Card Default Prediction

## Overview
This project involves the implementation of a predictive model to identify credit card default using various machine learning techniques. The project was completed in [Month/Year].

## Description
- Utilized Python with pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn for data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization.
- Implemented classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Conducted feature engineering to create new columns and addressed data imbalances.

## Project Structure
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
  - Removed unnecessary columns and handled missing values.
  - Resolved issues in the 'EDUCATION' and 'MARRIAGE' columns by replacing and categorizing values.
  - Detected and removed duplicate entries.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of variables and identify patterns.
  - Visualized relationships between variables using pair plots, heatmaps, and other plots.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Created new columns such as the sum of payment history ('PAY'), bill amounts ('BILL_AMT'), and payment amounts ('PAY_AMT').
  - Applied data standardization to make variables comparable.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Utilized seaborn and matplotlib to visualize correlations, distribution, and relationships between features.
  - Employed various plots such as pair plots, heatmaps, line plots, and scatter plots.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Trained multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
  - Evaluated model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

- **Results:**
  - Identified key features influencing credit card default.
  - Visualized relationships between payment behavior, credit limits, and default status.
  - Developed models with predictive accuracy and interpreted model results.
